# WhatsApp Auto Reply Agent using Droidrun

## Problem
Replying to repetitive WhatsApp messages like "hi", "price", or "location" takes time.

## Solution
This project uses the Droidrun framework to build a mobile agent that automatically:
- Reads the latest WhatsApp message
- Decides a reply based on message content
- Sends an automatic response

## Agentic Behavior
The agent observes incoming messages, makes decisions using rules, and performs actions autonomously.

## Tech Stack
- Droidrun Framework
- Python
- Android Device / Emulator

## Demo Video
